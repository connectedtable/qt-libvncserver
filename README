-- About

qt-libvncserver is a graphics driver for Qt embedded. It uses the library
LibVNCServer to act as a middle hand instead of the internal vnc plugin
bundled with Qt.

-- Usage

To compile and install qt-libvncserver
 * qmake (with a embedded enabled Qt)
 * make install

To run an application simply add "-qws -display libvnc:0" to command line to
start a VNC server on port 5900. Increase the number to use different ports.
libvnc:5 equals port 5905.

Depth and resolution are sent as environmental variables, named QWS_DEPTH and
QWS_SIZE, such as:

QWS_DEPTH=16 QWS_SIZE=800x600 ./example -qws -display libvnc:0

-- OTP tokens

The library also have support for one time passwords. If the application is 
started with the enviromental variable TOKEN_PATH the application checks
for this file on new connects and all data in this file is used as the current
valid password.
